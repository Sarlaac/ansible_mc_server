# Ansible Minecraft Server

This repository provides the steps to bootstrap a minecraft server using Ansible. The process is only designed to work on Ubuntu server, but likely works on similar linux systems. It should be ran locally by a user with sudo privledges.

Feel free to borrow / steal this and modify for your own needs.

- If you don't have git or Ansible installed start by running:
```
source bootstrap.sh
```
- Once you have Ansible, and cloned the repo, run:
```
ansible-playbook install_mc_docker.yml
```
